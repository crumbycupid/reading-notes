This lesson is important, because it seems almost every website has some form of audio and or video content. Also, learning the grid, is a key
tool in order layout your website. Knowing these methods will help create better web pages. 

Video and Audio Content

1. Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.
In the early 2000s video and audio were ran by pug in technologies such as flash, and silverlight. 

2. Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the <video> element.
  The src attribute gives the source information of the video, the same as it works with the img elembent. The controls attribute
  gives a way of controling the video. 

3. Why is it important to have fallback content inside the <video> element?
  Its important to have fallback content because the video may not play or be supported by a browser. So for accessibility, 
  This will give a description, and maybe even a link to the source of the video so that it may be played from there. 

4.Write a very short story where <audio> and <video> are characters.

sentences.
  Grid container is the elemement on which the grid is displayed. 
  Grid item is the children or direct descendents of the grid container.

Responsive Images

1. Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?
  Making responsive images, improves user experience and load time, gives the right image for the size screen being viewed, and delivers
  optimal file size. 

2. Define the following <img> attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used.
  srcset defines the images that will be chosen between, as well as the sizes. Sizes decides a set of media conditions, and determines, which
  image will be best to used, based on the values that we already set.

3. How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?
  Browsers preload images, before the main parser begins to read the css and js. This is bad because the wrong image could begin, and may already have 
  loaded in, by the time the css and js has been interpreted. Then the correct image would need to be loaded in, which creates longer load times.
