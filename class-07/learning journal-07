Today I learned about constructor which is pretty much an object for objects. I also learned about building tables. 



The most unexpected part of this experience has been the return to critical thinking. I have been fortunate enough to do well in school,
because picking up on learning was normally easy. This is making my brain hurt. I wouldn't say that the concepts are "hard" to grasp, but 
it does take some explaining, and a lot of thinking as well as re-work. I've learned that I get frustrated when I don't easily understand 
things. But if I keep a cool head, and search for the problem, or answers, then most of the time I find them. There is always an answer, 
so no there's no point in going crazy. I also learned that I need to ask for help. I learn the best by doing, and lab time where I can work 
with someone 1 on 1 while actually doing, benefits me tremendously. I have a lot of aha moments.
