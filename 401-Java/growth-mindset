Deliberate Practice 

Push past the comfort zone. Repeat often. Highly mentally demanding. Difficult. Requires goals. 
  The ordianary mundane work tasks do not help progress. Deliberate hardening creates skills. 
  
  Praise the process. Difficulty means not yet. Not yet. Embrace and praise the progress and process of difficulty and the growth mindset. 
  
Grit : Passion and perserverance for long very term goals. Stamina. Stick with your future day in and day out. Live life like a marathon, 
  not a sprint. The ability to learn is not fixed, it can change with effort. Failure is not a permanent condition. 
  
What is success? Is your idea of success truly your own?

Emotional Intelligence. 
  Self awareness and relationship management are area that I need to work on. I need to do better with identifying my emotions, and taking time
  to stop, reflect and act positively. I scored better on self management and social awareness, yet these areas need improving as well. As mentioned, 
  I could use work with managing my emotions, as well as being able to read and empathize with others. 
  
Biases
  My strongest area in this topic is understanding what bias is, and how it consciously or subconsciously plays a role in our everday lives. 
  My lowest scoring area was empathy and curiosity. 
  I will work on empathy and curiousity in the coming weeks. I will try and learn from difficult situations, and empathize with others.
