This lesson is important to learn the basics of Java. To learn about expressions, statements, and code blocks, as well as compilation. This is the 
foundation of coding with Java and getting things to work. 

Java 
  1. What does “strong typed” mean?
    In Java you must declare every variable with a data type. 
    
  2.   Explain to a non-technical friend the difference in how compilation works in Java and JavaScript.
    Computers use 1's and 0's to operate. Thats all they read or understand. Humans read in letters, words
  , numbers, functions, etc. Compilation allows us to write out whatever we want, and have it decoded
  into the 1's and 0's that the computer can understand. Java compiles its code and it is run on a virtual
  machine, whereas JavaScripts code is run directly on the browser. JavaScript code is all text, whereas
  Java code must be compiled.
