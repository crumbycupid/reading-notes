Purely functional programming treats all computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. Program state and mutable objects are usually
modeled with temporal logic. Purely functional programming ensures that functions inside the functional paradigm will only depend on their arguments
regardless of any global or local state. A pure functional subroutine only has visibility of changes of state represented by state variables included
in its scope.Purely functional data sources are persistent. Functional programming is able to use persistent non-purely functional data sources that
may not be used in purely functional programming. In purely functional programming, each evaluation strategy returns the same result.
