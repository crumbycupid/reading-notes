Learn CSS - Flexbox

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
  It only deals with lay-out in one direction at a time. (columns or rows.)

2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
  The main axis moves along the direction of your flex direction property.
  The cross axis moves in the other direction. So if your main axis is a row, then your cross axis 
   is a column. 

3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
  Yes. Using order can fix things being out of order in a document, which is problematic, if logically, they should 
  be in a different order.

1. What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?
  Flexbox makes it much easier to postion groups of content over using float, such as 'vertically centering a block of content inside its parent element',
  and 'making the children of a container take up an equal amount of space, regardless of how much space is available.'
  
2. How does this topic connect with your long term goals?
 This topic connects with my longterm goals, because it will allow me to more easily and efficient style and position groups of information on any
