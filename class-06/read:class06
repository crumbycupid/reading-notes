This assignment gives me a better understanding of objects and the DOM. Objects will help me group together large quantities of information, just as a
store, and the DOM helps me to understand how Java Script is able to function.

1. How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?
  I would describe an object as a box full of a lot of different things, no matter what they may be, that just serves as a container for said objects. 

2 .What are some advantages to creating object literals?
  Object literals are easily reusable, and you may encapsulate the code, preventing clashing of variable or function names. 

3. How do objects differ from arrays?
  Objects represent things, while arrays create and store lists of data in single varibles. 

4. Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.
  If an object property is held in a variable, then you would need to use bracket notation over dot notation. 

5. Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?
const dog = {
  name: 'Spot',
  age: 2,
  color: 'white with black spots',
  humanAge: function (){
    console.log(`${this.name} is ${this.age*7} in human years`);
  }
}

This refers to the current object the code is being written inside. It allows you to use the same method definition for every object you create. 

Introduction To The DOM

1. What is the DOM?
  The document object model(DOM) a programming interface for web models, representing the page, so that programs may change the document structure, style,
  and content. 

2. Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.
  The DOM is a Web API used to build Websites, not a programming language like Java Script. Java Script need DOM in order to have a notion webpages, html
  documents, svg documents, and their component parts.
