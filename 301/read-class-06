6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
Greater efficiency, engaged collaboration, learning from fellow students, social skills, job interview readiness, work enviornment readiness. 

2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
Engaged collaboration and learning from fellow students goes hand in hand for me. Two minds are better than one, and having someone to talk to and share
insights with is invaluable!

3. How does pair programming work?
There is a driver and a navigator. The driver does all of the hands on work and keyboard work, while the navigator does all of the "navigating" or 
explaing to the driver what to do. The navigator does not touch the keyboard. When collaboration is needed, both stop, and confer with one another.
