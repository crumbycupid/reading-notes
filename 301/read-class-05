React Docs - Thinking in React

1. What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?
The single responsibility principle is the principle that a component should only do one thing. 

2. What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?
Build a version of your app that renders the UI, but has no interactivity.

3. Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?
State.

4. What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?
Is it passed in from parents via props?
Does it remain unchanged over time?
Can you compute it based on any other states or props in your component?

5. How can you identify where state needs to live?
Identify every component that renders something based on that state. 
Find a common owner component.
The common owner, or another component higher in the hierarchy should own the state. 

Higher-Order Functions

1. What is a “higher-order function”?
A function that operates on another function. 

2. Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?
Returning a function m, where m is greater than the variable n.

3. Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions.
They take values from other functions, and return new values by combining them with the onld values.
