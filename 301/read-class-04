React Docs - Forms

1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
A component where data is handled by the components state. 

2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
Update immediately because they automatically merge.

pass it an argument .

} else {
  console.log(false);
}
