This will help me to understand the differences between these two databases, 
as I will use them in the future. 

nosql vs sql

Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

SQL	                                                   NoSQL
relational model, tables and colums                     data documents
vertically scalable                                     horizontally scalable 
set query language, easy queries                       complex queries because there is no set language
will need a larger server for larger data amounts.      additional servers may be added to existing ones. 
best for complex queries                                best for unstructured data.
 	 
 	 
 	 
What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

Give a real world example.
Dates, and times. 

What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
structured, semi structure, and 

Give a real world example.
document data bases, key value databases

Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
sql

Which type of database is best for scalability?
nosql

What does SQL stand for?
Structured query language.

What is a relational database?
a database where data is organized into predefined relationships. 

What type of structure does a relational database work with?
tables, rows and columns

What is a ‘schema’?
a list of logical structures of data. 

What is a NoSQL database?
a non tabular database.

How does it work?
It stores data in documents rather than tables

What is inside of a MongoDB database
data records as documents, gathered as collections. 

Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
MongoDB, it allows different structures, and can use a format that best fits the data. 

What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
They dont support ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability).
