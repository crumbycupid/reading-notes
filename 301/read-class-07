How I explained REST to my brother

Who is Roy Fielding?
He helped write the first web servers. 

Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
They weren't originally designed to be used that way. They were designed to just talk to one machine, or a small group of machines, not
all the machines in the world.

What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
It applies verbs to nouns. 

What does a GET do?
It gets the human readable, and machine readable information. 

What does a POST do?
Allows one system to add something to another. 

What does PUT do?
Allows a system to replace something in another .

What does PATCH do?
Applies a partial update.
